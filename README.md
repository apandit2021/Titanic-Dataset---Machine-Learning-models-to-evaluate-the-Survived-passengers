Here I have used the popular Titanic Dataset as available from Kaggle site (https://www.kaggle.com/), performed exploratory data analysis/visualization and implemented famous machine learning models (Support vector machine, K nearest neighbors, decision tree, and random forest) to predict about the Survival of the passengers (using other available correlated features/variables) in the Titanic ship wreck.
